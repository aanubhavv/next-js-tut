# Day 1

## commands used:

### Theory

- layout.tsx acts as the parent for all the routes.
- layout is a root component that shares one code across all children.
- we can create different layout files for specific components/pages.
- but then we would get conflicting code from root layout and new layout that is why we need 🔽
- Route groups: they allow you to organize the route segments in project structure without impacting the url path. eg. (folder_name)
